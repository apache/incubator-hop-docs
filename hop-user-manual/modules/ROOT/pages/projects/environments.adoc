== Managing projects and environments

Most developers who design and manage data processing on a daily basis work on a multitude of projects and modules. Different sets of workflows and pipelines require management for at least development, acceptance and production environments. Every project or environment comes with its own set of variables and configurations for databases, file paths, ..

=== How does Hop manage projects and environments

Hop allows developers to manage different projects and environments with their corresponding configurations and variables. Hierarchically each project can have multiple environments with different purposes. Each project will remember opened files, zoom levels and other UI settings.

=== Creating a project

To create a new project click the *Add a new project* button.

This button opens the following dialogue:

.Project Properties
[id="tab-proj-props", cols="20%,45%,5%,5%,25%", option="header]
|===
|Property|Description|Variables Supported|Mandatory|Default
|Name|The project name|Yes|No|
|Home folder|The folder where the project is located|Yes|No|
|Configuration file (relative path)|The folder where the project's configuration json is located.|Yes|Yes|
|Description|A description for this environment|No|No|
|Company|The company this environment belongs to|No|No|
|Department|The department this environment is created for|No|No|
|Metadata base folder|The folder where this environment's metadata will be stored|Yes|Yes|${ENVIRONMENT_HOME}/metadata
|Unit test base path|The folder where this environment's unit tests will be stored|Yes|Yes|${ENVIRONMENT_HOME}
|Data Sets CSV Folder|The folder where this environment's data files will be stored|Yes|Yes|${ENVIRONMENT_HOME}/datasets
|Enforce execution in environment home|Give an error when trying to execute a pipeline or workflow which is not located in the environment home directory or in a sub-directory|Yes|Yes|checked
|Project variables to set|A list of variable names, values and variable descriptions to use with this project|No|Yes|
|===

After creating a project the user interface will switch to it and ask if you want to create an environment.

After creating an environment the user interface will switch to it.

=== Switching between projects and environments

To switch between projects the projects list can be used from the main Hop Gui toolbar.

After switching to a project the environments list will be updated to the environments which belong to this project. All open files will be restored, including their zoom level and other UI settings.

=== Editing and deleting projects

To edit an existing project click the *Edit the selected project* button.

Clicking this button will re-open the project dialogue where changes can be made as described in <<tab-proj-props>>.

To delete a project click the *Delete the selected project* button.

=== Advanced project and environment management

==== Configuration files

Configuration files will be stored in the chosen project home directory as a json file. An environment can be set to point to (multiple) different configuration files as is needed. These config files contain the following:

[source,json]
{
  "metadataBaseFolder" : "${PROJECT_HOME}/metadata",
  "unitTestsBasePath" : "${PROJECT_HOME}",
  "dataSetsCsvFolder" : "${PROJECT_HOME}/datasets",
  "enforcingExecutionInHome" : true,
  "config" : {
    "variables" : [ {
      "name" : "foo"
    } ]
  }
}%

==== Advanced Hop environment configuration

Hop enviroments and their home folders are stored in the hop configuration file 'hop-config.json'. That file lives by default in the *config* folder of the Hop installation. System property 'HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER' can also be used to point to a different folder

[source,json]
{
 "environmentConfig" : {
  "enabled" : true,
  "openingLastEnvironmentAtStartup" : true,
  "environmentConfigFilename" : "environment.json",
  "environmentFolders" : {
   "Project 1 - DEV" : "/projects/one/dev/",
   "Project 1 - UAT" : "/projects/one/uat/",
   "Project 1 - PRD" : "/projects/one/prd/",
   "Project 2 - DEV" : "/projects/two/dev/",
   "Project 2 - UAT" : "/projects/two/uat/",
   "Project 2 - PRD" : "/projects/two/prd/",
  }
}

== The Hop command line configuration tool

Hop Conf is a command line tool to manage environments. The *hop-conf.sh* script can be run with the *-h* flag (`./hop-conf.sh -h`) to display available options.

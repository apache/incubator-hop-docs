= Virtual File Systems

== Descriptions

Apache Hop makes fervent usage of the https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-vfs/[Apache Virtual File System (VFS) project].  Beyond the standard https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-vfs/filesystems.html[file system types] of this Apache Commons project we have added a number which are present in the various technology stacks supported by Hop.  Like the standard file systems each has its own unique name scheme which you can use.
